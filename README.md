As a junior studying Data Science and Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley, I am interested in the intersection between data, technology, and human cognition-- specifically, the fields of ethical human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence for the public good. Currently, I am working on polishing my data analysis skills using Python Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib as well as SQL! 

A fun fact about me is that I spent all of my childhood in Russia :)
 
I will be using this space to discuss and take note of the things I have learned during my time as an Intern in the Conversation Engineer Team at Soul Machines.

* Basic set-up of a script 
- REPO
 - directory of the same name
  - scripts (directory)
    - the_main_script.py
    - __init__.py
  - tests (directory)
    - test_the_main_script.py
    - __init__.py
  - data (directory)

* How do Webhooks work?
An HTTP callback, when triggered at an application/website, collects the relevant data and sends it over to the URL specified via the form of an HTTP request; then the predefined action is performed on that request. 

Fundamentally, API calls work on request-based output mechanisms while webhooks work on event-based output mechanisms. 

need: webhook service - accepts and returns JSON object

helpful for: 
- knowledge that a certain event has taken place
- ensure data is synced across multiple web applications
- customize responses
- connect 2+ apps so that one event triggers responses across multiple apps at the same time 

* How do DialogFlow Webhook Fulfillments work?
Fulfillments allow for more dynamic responses to intents that have been matched.
-> each intent has a setting to enable webhook fulfillment
-> when such an intent is matched, DialogFlow sends a request to your specified webhook service

the full overview:
1. The end-user types or speaks an expression.
2. DF matches the end-user expression to a certain intent and extracts according parameters.
3. DF sends a webhook request message to your webhook service. This message contains information about the matched intent, action, parameters, and the response defined for the intent. 
4. Your service performs actions as necessary i.e. database queries or external API calls
5. Your service sends a webhook request message to DF. This message contains the response that should be sent to the end-user.
6. DF sends the response to end-user.
7. The end-user sees or hears the response.
