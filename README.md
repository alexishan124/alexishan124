As a junior studying Data Science and Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley, I am interested in the intersection between data, technology, and human cognition-- specifically, the fields of ethical human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence for the public good. Currently, I am working on polishing my data analysis skills using Python Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib as well as SQL! 

A fun fact about me is that I spent all of my childhood in Russia :)
 
I will be using this space to discuss and take note of the things I have learned during my time as an Intern in the Conversation Engineer Team at Soul Machines.
